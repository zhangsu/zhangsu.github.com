# Lover

A product of MolyJam Toronto 2012.

Imagine yourself underwater, drowning desperately. The only way to make you able to breath and survive there is to get close to your loved one and hug him/her with a passion. No, just walk beside him/her is not enough; you have to move toward him/her!

## Control

- Two-player game

- One player uses keyboard arrow keys to move the boy

- The other player moves mouse to change the girl's moving direction

## User Interface

- Breath bar on the left indicates the amount of breath the boy has

- Breath bar on the right indicates the amount of breath the girl has

## Mechanism

- You die if you collide with any of the evil underwater creatures

- You die if your breath bar runs out

- The boy and the girl have different moving, breath loss and regeneration rate

- The longer you survive, the more score you earn
    
- Yes, there is no end

- When your loved one dies, the game is not over yet; you watch the body of your loved one fade away and regret in agony for the rest (a few second) of your life :(
