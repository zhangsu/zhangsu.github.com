# Lover

Imagine yourself underwater, drowning desperately. The only way to make you able to breath and survive there is to get close to your loved one and hug him/her with a passion. No, just walk beside him/her is not enough; you have to move toward him/her!

## Control

- Keyboard arrow keys control the moving direction of the male character

- The relative mouse position determines the moving direction of the female character

## User Interface

- Breath bar on the left indicates the amount of breath the male character has

- Breath bar on the right indicates the amount of breath the female character has

## Mechanism

- You die if you collide with any of the evil underwater creatures

- You die if your breath bar runs out

- Male and female characters have different moving, breath loss and regeneration rate
    
- The longer you survive, the more score you earn
    
- Yes, there is no end

- When your loved one dies, the game is not over yet; you watch the body of your loved one fade away and regret in agony for the rest (a few second) of your life :(
